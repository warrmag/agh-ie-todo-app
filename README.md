# agh-ie-todo-app
Simple todo app with Angular UI &amp; Symfony Backend

App should be fully containerized so all you need is Docker installed on your local machine.

Just simply run: ``docker-compose up`` in main project directory

if it is your first run please don't use -d option to bring up project

It can take a while

We should expect message:

```
todo-app-php | [21-Dec-2019 19:58:16] NOTICE: ready to handle connections
```
or 
```
agh-pass-frontend | ** Angular Live Development Server is listening on 0.0.0.0:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/ **
agh-pass-frontend | ℹ ｢wdm｣: Compiled successfully.
```

Frontend should be enabled at: ``localhost:4200``
